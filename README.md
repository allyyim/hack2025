# ADO PRism for the MRTA 2025 hackthon

> **Transforming PR discussions into consumable knowledge signals**

## Overview

ADO PRism addresses the executive challenge of enabling AI agents to discover, understand, and safely consume real-time signals without rebuilding custom plumbing. By analyzing Azure DevOps PR comments through Azure OpenAI, it automatically extracts and structures valuable team knowledge-technical terms, troubleshooting steps, and developer best practices-into consumable signals that both AI agents and developers can easily discover and integrate.

## The Challenge

Teams waste time rebuilding the same knowledge extraction pipelines to make legaxy knowledge accessible. PR comments contain invaluable insights, but they remain buried in unstructured PR comment threads.

## The Solution

ADO PRism creates a standardized pipeline that:
- **Discovers** hidden knowledge within PR discussions in real-time
- **Understands** context using Azure OpenAI to classify insights into actionable categories
- **Delivers** structured, consumable signals through markdown files and APIs
- **Eliminates** the need for teams to rebuild knowledge extraction from scratch

Powered by Azure OpenAI and Azure DevOps APIs, ADO PRism ensures that important insights are never overlooked and always accessible.
